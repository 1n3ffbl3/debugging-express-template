# Debugging Express

In this project you'll get your first experience with Express.js and web applications by running and debugging a series of very simple servers.  To get the most out of these exercises we recommend following this process:
1. Run the file in Node (node debug-x-y.js) - What prints in the terminal?
2. Check the Browser (localhost:XXXX) - What displays in the browser?
3. Check the source code - How is this creating what you see in the browser and terminal?

Not all of these are broken!  Some of them will show different ways of making the same thing happen.  Take note of these differences, which seem like a better way to you?  Take good notes on each file in this README.  These files illustrate some of the most common bugs you'll come across, the more carefully you complete this project the more useful it will be as a reference later on.

(PS.  app7 -> app9 use EJS.  We won't be covering this in class, so follow these as far as your curiosity takes you.)
